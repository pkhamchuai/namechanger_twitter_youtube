# namechanger_twitter_youtube
**This is the twitter name changer according to view count of a youtube video.** This version of code works in colab. 
I made another version that doesn't need to get the channel information, but it doesn't run in colab, only runs in my local computer.

Ex: 'Dod di dong' has: 149,132,558 views.
